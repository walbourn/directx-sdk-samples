# DXUT for Direct3D 11

http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=320437

Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

**February 12, 2023**

DXUT is a "GLUT"-like framework for Direct3D 11.x Win32 desktop applications; primarily samples, demos, and prototypes.

This code is designed to build with Visual Studio 2019 (16.11) or Visual Studio 2022. Use of the Windows 10 May 2020 Update SDK ([19041](https://walbourn.github.io/windows-10-may-2020-update-sdk/)) or later is required.

These components are designed to work without requiring any content from the legacy DirectX SDK. For details, see [Where is the DirectX SDK?](https://aka.ms/dxsdk).

*This project is 'archived'. It is still available for use for legacy projects or when using older developer education materials, but use of it for new projects is not recommended.*

## Disclaimer

DXUT is being provided as a porting aid for older code that makes use of the legacy DirectX SDK, the deprecated D3DX9/D3DX11 library, and the DXUT11 framework. It is a cleaned up version of the original DXUT11 that will build with the Windows 8.1 / 10 SDK and does not make use of any legacy DirectX SDK or DirectSetup deployed components.

The DXUT framework is for use in Win32 desktop applications. It not usable for Universal Windows Platform apps, Windows Store apps,
Xbox, or Windows phone.

This version of DXUT only supports Direct3D 11, and therefore is not compatible with Windows XP or early versions of Windows Vista.

> The legacy versions of **DXUT for DX11/DX9** and **DXUT for DX10/DX9** version are on [GitHub](https://github.com/walbourn/directx-sdk-legacy-samples). These both require using [Microsoft.DXSDK.D3DX](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.DXSDK.D3DX).

## Release Notes

* Starting with the July 2022 release, the ``bool forceSRGB`` parameter for DDSTextureLoader ``Ex`` functions is now a ``DDS_LOADER_FLAGS`` typed enum bitmask flag parameter. This may have a *breaking change* impact to client code. Replace ``true`` with ``DDS_LOADER_FORCE_SRGB`` and ``false`` with ``DDS_LOADER_DEFAULT``.

* There are known codegen issues when mixing the library built with Visual C++ and the sample built with recent builds of clang/LLVM for Windows. Building both the library and the sample using the same complier avoids the issue.
