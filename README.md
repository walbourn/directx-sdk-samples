# DirectX SDK Samples

This repo contains samples that originally shipped in the legacy DirectX SDK. These are all **Windows desktop** applications for Windows Vista Service Pack 2 with the DirectX 11.0 runtime or later.

They have all been cleaned up to build using the Windows 8.x SDK or Windows 10 SDK, and _DO NOT_ require the DirectX SDK to build. Projects for Visual Studio 2013 and 2015 are provided.
