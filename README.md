# DirectX SDK Samples

This repo contains Direct3D 11, XInput, and XAudio2 samples that originally shipped in the legacy DirectX SDK. These are all **Windows desktop** applications for Windows 7 Service Pack 1 or later.

They have all been cleaned up to build using the Windows 10 SDK, and _DO NOT_ require the legacy DirectX SDK to build. Projects for Visual Studio 2019 are provided, and can be upgraded to VS 2022. CMake projects are also provided along with preset files for a subset of samples. The CMake files support building with MSVC, clang/LLVM for Windows, and some also support using MinGW.

> The remainder of the legacy DirectX SDK samples for Direct3D 10, Direct3D 9, etc. can be found [directx-sdk-legacy-samples](https://github.com/walbourn/directx-sdk-legacy-samples). These make use of the Microsoft.DXSDK.D3DX NuGet so also _DO NOT_ require the legacy DirectX SDK to build.
