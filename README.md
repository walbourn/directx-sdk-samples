# DirectX SDK Samples

This repo contains Direct3D 11, XInput, and XAudio2 samples that originally shipped in the legacy DirectX SDK. These are all **Windows desktop** applications for Windows 7 Service Pack 1 or later.

They have all been cleaned up to build using the Windows 10 SDK, and _DO NOT_ require the DirectX SDK to build. Projects for Visual Studio 2019 are provided, and can be upgraded to VS 2022.

> The remainder of the legacy DirectX SDK samples for Direct3D 10, Direct3D 9, etc. can be found [directx-sdk-legacy-samples](https://github.com/walbourn/directx-sdk-legacy-samples). These make use of the Microsoft.DXSDK.D3DX NuGet so also _DO NOT_ require the legacy DirectX SDK to build.
