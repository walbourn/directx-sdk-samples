**August 17, 2022**

Effects for Direct3D 11 (FX11) is a management runtime for authoring HLSL shaders, render state, and runtime variables together.

This code is designed to build with Visual Studio 2019 (16.9 or later) or Visual Studio 2022. Use of the Windows 10 May 2020 Update SDK ([19041](https://walbourn.github.io/windows-10-may-2020-update-sdk/)) or later is required.

These components are designed to work without requiring any content from the legacy DirectX SDK. For details, see [Where is the DirectX SDK?](https://aka.ms/dxsdk).

*This project is 'archived'. It is still available for use for legacy projects or when using older developer education materials, but use of it for new projects is not recommended.*

## Disclaimer

Effects 11 is being provided as a porting aid for older code that makes use of the Effects 10 (FX10) API or Effects 9 (FX9)
API in the deprecated D3DX9 library. See [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d11/d3d11-graphics-programming-guide-effects-differences) for a list of differences compared to the Effects 10 (FX10) library.

The Effects 11 library is for use in Win32 desktop applications. FX11 requires the D3DCompiler API be available at runtime
to provide shader reflection functionality, and this API is not deployable for Windows Store apps on Windows 8.0, Windows RT,
or Windows phone 8.0.

The fx_5_0 profile support in the HLSL compiler is deprecated, and does not fully support DirectX 11.1 HLSL features
such as minimum precision types. It is supported in the Windows 8.1 SDK version of the HLSL compiler (FXC.EXE) and
D3DCompile API (46), is supported but generates a deprecation warning with D3DCompile API (47). The fx profiles
are not supported by the DXIL (DXC.EXE) compiler.
